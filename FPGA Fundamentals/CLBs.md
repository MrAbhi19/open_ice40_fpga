# What is a CLB?

Configurable Logic Block (CLB) is the core building unit inside an FPGA. If LUTs are the neurons, CLBs are the brain cells that organize them into something powerful. 

**A CLB typically contains:**
  - LUTs (Look-Up Tables)
  - D-Flip-Flops
  - Multiplexers
  - Carry logic

[we have already discussed about LUTs](LUTS.md)

→**D-Flip-Flop**

A D Flip-Flop (DFF) is a fundamental sequential logic circuit that stores one bit of binary data. It captures the value of the input (D) on the rising or falling edge of a clock signal, and holds that value stable until the next clock event.
