# ICE40 LP384

The iCE40 is a family of low-power, compact FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) developed by Lattice Semiconductor. They're especially popular in hobbyist, open-source, and embedded systems communities thanks to their affordability and support for open-source toolchains.

The iCE40 LP384 is one of the smallest and most power-efficient members of the iCE40 LP family of FPGAs from Lattice Semiconductor. It's designed for ultra-low-power applications where space and energy are at a premiumâ€”think wearables, small IoT devices, and embedded systems. Where 384 represents that there 384 Logic cells (LookUp Table (LUT) + D-Flip-Flop) in the chip.
