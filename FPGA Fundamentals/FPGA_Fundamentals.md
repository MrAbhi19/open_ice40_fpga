# FPGA

**FPGA** (Field Programmable Gate Array) is an integrated circuit that can be **programmed and reprogrammed** after manufacturing to perform custom digital logic. Think of it like a blank canvas for digital circuits ‚Äî instead of writing software instructions for a CPU, you describe **hardware** (wires, gates, flip-flops) that is synthesized into the FPGA‚Äôs logic.

Common languages: **VHDL** and **Verilog** (hardware description languages). These describe structure and timing rather than sequential program execution.

# ICE40 LP384

The **iCE40** family is a line of **low-power, compact FPGAs** by Lattice Semiconductor. They are popular in hobbyist and open-source communities because they‚Äôre inexpensive, low-power, and supported by open-source toolchains.

The **iCE40 LP384** is a very small, ultra-low-power member of that family, suited to wearables, tiny IoT devices, and space-constrained embedded systems.  
> üí° *The ‚Äú384‚Äù denotes roughly 384 logic cells (LUT + D-FF).*

# Architecture Overview

A single **ICE40 LP384** contains:

- üî∑ **Programmable Logic Blocks (PLB)**  
- üß† **4 kbit RAM**  
- üîÅ **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)**  
- üîå **SPI Bank**  
- üíæ **Non-Volatile Configuration Memory (NVCM)**  
- üîó **I/O Bank**

### Diving deeper into logic

- üî∑ **Programmable Logic Blocks (PLB)**  
  The core of an FPGA: blocks of logic that you program to implement functions.

- **Each PLB consists of eight interconnected Logic Cells (LC).**

#### Logic cells

Each Logic Cell contains 3 logic elements:

1. **4-input LUT (LUT4)** ‚Äî implements any combinational function of up to 4 inputs (behaves like a 16√ó1 ROM).  
2. **D Flip-Flop (DFF)** ‚Äî sequential element, optional clock-enable and reset for state.  
3. **Carry Logic** ‚Äî efficient support for adders, counters, comparators, and cascaded arithmetic.

*(Refer to the datasheet for signal descriptions, clock/control networks, GBUF connections to PLBs.)*

#### sysCLOCK Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs)

PLLs generate and manage clock signals inside the iCE40. They help align clock phases and provide frequency scaling and jitter management across domains.

*(Refer to the datasheet for PLL signal descriptions, sysMEM block configuration, EBR signal descriptions.)*

# How an FPGA differs from other hardware

Quick conceptual anchors to avoid confusion:

- **Microcontroller (MCU)**: fixed CPU core + memory; you write software (sequential instructions). Easier to program for many tasks, but limited by CPU architecture and instruction throughput.

- **ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)**: fixed hardware designed for one job ‚Äî very fast and efficient but **not** reprogrammable and expensive to make.

- **FPGA**: programmable **hardware**. You describe circuits (parallel structure). More flexible than an ASIC, faster/parallel than a CPU for many tasks, but constrained by resources (logic cells, RAM, I/O). Good for prototyping, accelerating algorithms, custom I/O handling.

# Programming model and design flow

Important mental shift: writing HDL is **describing hardware**, not writing imperative code.

High-level flow:
1. **Design in HDL** (Verilog/VHDL or higher-level languages/tools). Describe combinational logic, registers, state machines, and modules.  
2. **Synthesis**: HDL ‚Üí gate-level netlist (map into FPGA primitives like LUTs, FFs).  
3. **Place & Route**: map netlist onto actual FPGA resources (PLBs, IOs, routing).  
4. **Bitstream generation**: final bitstream or configuration file for the device.  
5. **Program device**: upload bitstream to NVCM or load at boot.

Key concepts to teach alongside:
- Clock domains and clock crossing (synchronizers).  
- Reset strategies and gated clocks vs. clock enables.  
- Timing constraints and setup/hold time.  
- Testbenches & simulation (functional and timing simulation).  
- Resource estimation: LUTs, FFs, Block RAM, I/O pins, PLLs.

# Practical constraints & design trade-offs

Designing for a tiny device like the iCE40 LP384 requires trade-offs:

- **Limited logic resources** ‚Äî you can‚Äôt implement arbitrarily large designs. Always budget LUT/FF usage.  
- **Limited RAM** ‚Äî only kilobits, so external memory or streaming algorithms may be necessary for data-heavy tasks.  
- **I/O pin limits** ‚Äî plan pin assignment and multiplexing.  
- **Clocking** ‚Äî few PLLs and clock resources; avoid too many independent high-frequency domains.  
- **Power vs. performance** ‚Äî LP family is optimized for power; pushing speed or heavy toggling increases power.  
- **Timing closure** ‚Äî small FPGAs still require timing-aware design (constraints).  
- **Tooling choices** ‚Äî open vs. vendor tools can affect flow (synthesis optimizations, timing reports, debug).  

Practical tips:
- Use carry chains for arithmetic to save LUTs and improve speed.  
- Prefer clock enables over generating many gated clocks.  
- Keep long combinational paths split with registers (pipelining).  
- Simulate early and often; small changes can affect place-and-route outcomes.

# Toolchain & ecosystem (iCE40 friendly)

The iCE40 family is attractive for hobbyists partly because of **open-source** tool support. Typical toolchain components you‚Äôll mention in a course:

- **Yosys** ‚Äî open-source synthesis (HDL ‚Üí netlist).  
- **NextPNR** ‚Äî place-and-route for iCE40 (and other families).  
- **Project IceStorm** ‚Äî tool suite for bitstream generation and reverse-engineered device documentation.  
- **OpenOCD / iceprog** ‚Äî programming tools to flash the bitstream to the device.  
- **Vendor tools** (Lattice) ‚Äî offer official support, timing-driven reports, and sometimes more optimizations; useful for production flows.

For simulation: **Icarus Verilog**, **Verilator** (cycle-accurate, powerful), or vendor-provided simulators. For debugging on-device: use simple UARTs, logic analyzers (e.g., Sigrok + Saleae), or internal debug registers to expose state.

# Where to look next (learning path & references)

Suggested learning path for learners:

1. **Small hands-on project**: blink an LED, then make a UART, then a simple SPI master or PWM audio.  
2. **Learn simulation/testing**: write testbenches and use Verilator.  
3. **Dive into timing**: setup/hold, multi-cycle paths, false paths.  
4. **Learn debugging**: use logic analyzers, instrument your design, add checksum/status registers.  
5. **Intermediate projects**: small CPU soft-core, audio DSP filter, or sensor fusion front-end.  
6. **Read the datasheet**: for PLLs, IO standards, power domains, and exact resource counts. (Datasheet is the final authority on signals and limits.)
