# open_ice40_fpga
An open-source journey into FPGA design and hardware. This project explains how an FPGA works from the inside out (LUTs, CLBs, routing, registers, CPUs) and documents the creation of a custom FPGA development board based on the Lattice iCE40. Inspired by boards like Tang Nano, but fully transparent and educational.
