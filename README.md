# Open iCE40 FPGA  

An open-source project where we are building our own custom FPGA boards similar to Tang nano using ice40 chip that also combines **FPGA education** with **custom hardware design**.  
We explore how FPGAs like the iCE40 work (LUTs, CLBs, routing, registers, CPUs) while also designing a custom FPGA development board from scratch.

## Goals
- ✅ Learn how an FPGA works internally (CLBs, LUTs, routing, etc.)  
- ✅ Build digital circuits (counters, adders, registers, CPUs) using custom CLB models  
- ✅ Design a custom FPGA development board using the Lattice iCE40  
- ✅ Share everything open-source for learning, hacking, and improving

## Roadmap
1. **FPGA Fundamentals**  
   - LUTs  
   - CLBs (with DFF + multiplexer)  
   - Adders, Counters, Registers  
   - Simple CPU with CLBs  

2. **Hardware Development**  
   - iCE40 chip selection  
   - Power supply design (5V → 3.3V regulators)  
   - USB/JTAG programming interface  
   - PCB layout and manufacturing  
   - Testing & bring-up  

3. **Final Board**  
   - Small, affordable FPGA board  
   - Open-source schematics + PCB  
   - Example projects and tutorials

## Why?  
Most FPGA boards are “black boxes.” With this project, you not only get a custom FPGA dev board but also learn **exactly how it works inside**. Perfect for students, hobbyists, and open-hardware enthusiasts.
